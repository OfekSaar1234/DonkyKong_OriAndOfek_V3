# DonkyKong_OriAndOfek_V3

A C++ implementation of the classic Donkey Kong-style game. In this project, Mario must rescue the princess while avoiding barrels and ghosts. The game is built with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), modular design, and code maintainability.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design:**  
  Characters such as Mario, barrels, and ghosts are implemented as separate objects using inheritance and polymorphism for code reuse and flexibility.

- **Gameplay Recording & Replay:**  
  Includes a system to record and replay gameplay, supporting debugging and analysis.

- **Clean, Maintainable Code:**  
  Code is structured for clarity and maintainability, making it easier to extend or modify.

- **Version Control:**  
  Project managed with Git to ensure smooth collaboration and track progress.

## What I Learned

- Advanced OOP concepts: inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- Game state management and modular design patterns
- Implementing custom gameplay recording/replay logic
- Practical use of Git for version control

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OfekSaar1234/DonkyKong_OriAndOfek_V3.git
   ```

2. **Open the solution:**  
   Open `DonkyKong_OriAndOfek_V3.sln` with Visual Studio.

3. **Build and run:**  
   Build the project and run the executable to start playing.

## Project Structure

- `DonkyKong_OriAndOfek_V3.sln` - Visual Studio solution file
- `automaticGame.cpp`, `manualGame.cpp` - Core game logic
- `Barrel.cpp`, `Ghost.cpp`, `Mario.cpp` - Character implementations
- Additional files for game states, utilities, and helpers
